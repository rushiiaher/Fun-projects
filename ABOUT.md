This project is a dynamic news web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The user interface is styled with Bootstrap 5, which provides a 
responsive design and components like the navbar, cards, and buttons to ensure the application works well across different devices. We use JavaScript'sFetch API to
retrieve real-time news data from NewsAPI, with endpoints for categories like general news, business, sports, entertainment, and technology.Bootstrap's grid system 
helps in organizing news articles into cards, making them visually appealing and easy to browse. The search functionality allows users to type in any keyword and 
fetch relevant news articles. Each article is displayed in a Bootstrap card format, showcasing the title, date, description, and a "Read more" link. The integration 
of RESTful API, asynchronous JavaScript, and Bootstrap ensures a seamless, responsive, and user-friendly experience.
